# Introduction to RuneScript

RuneScript is the custom scripting language used in 2004Scape to define game content and behavior. It's designed to be simple and focused on the specific needs of RuneScape content development.

## Coming Soon

A detailed guide to RuneScript is coming soon. In the meantime, you can explore example scripts in the [2004Scape Server repository](https://github.com/2004Scape/Server/tree/main/data/src/scripts).

Check back for updates as we continue to build out our documentation.
